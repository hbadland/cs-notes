## 📘 Contents

- **Data Structures**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Hash Tables, Trees, Heaps, Graphs
- **Algorithms**
  - Searching & Sorting
  - Recursion & Dynamic Programming
  - Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- **Complexity & Theory**
  - Big-O Analysis
  - Time & Space Complexity
  - Abstract Data Types
- **Memory & Systems**
  - Stack vs Heap
  - Pointers and References
- *(more to come as I continue studying)*

# 🧠 CS Notes & Projects

These are my computer science notes, written in Jupyter Notebooks and organized by topic. These notes aim to explain concepts clearly, demonstrate applications through code, and are accompanied by links to the best external resources I’ve encountered. These notes were written alongside my BSc Chemistry degree.

> **👨‍🔬 Goal**: Build a strong theoretical and practical foundation in CS to support interdisciplinary work in computational chemistry, AI, and beyond.
