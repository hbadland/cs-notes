## 📘 Contents

- **Data Structures**
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
  - Hash Tables, Trees, Heaps, Graphs
- **Algorithms**
  - Searching & Sorting
  - Recursion & Dynamic Programming
  - Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS), Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- **Complexity & Theory**

# 🧠 CS Notes & Projects

These notes were written alongside my BSc Chemistry degree to support my project and further expand my knowledge of this field.

> **👨‍🔬 Goal**: Build a strong theoretical and practical foundation in CS to support interdisciplinary work in computational chemistry and AI.
